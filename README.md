The global call for more sustainable energy development and natural resource management hinges on both the technical ability and social capacity to harness the potentials from these resources. 
Symbolic Regression in Energy Engineering explores leveraging machine learning to solve renewable energy challenges arising from the notorious volatility of resources. Symbolic regression, a machine learning technique, uncovers mathematical models from data without predefined structures, thus providing interpretable and accurate models. This thesis investigates symbolic regression's applications in energy engineering, particularly in predicting renewable energy outputs such as wind speed against power output, which are highly variable and unpredictable. The study utilizes genetic programming to evolve symbolic expressions that model complex relationships within wind energy systems. The methodology includes collecting and preprocessing data, training symbolic regression algorithms, and evaluating models using various metrics. The results demonstrate symbolic regression's effectiveness in creating predictive models that outperform traditional regression methods in both accuracy and interpretability. By capturing intrinsic data patterns, symbolic regression offers a promising approach to enhancing the reliability and efficiency of renewable energy systems. The discussion highlights the advantages of symbolic regression over traditional methods, including better model interpretability and reduced human bias, and suggests future research directions to further improve this technique's applicability in energy engineering.
This abstract captures the essence of the thesis, highlighting the importance of symbolic regression in addressing renewable energy challenges, the methodology employed, and the significance of the results obtained.
